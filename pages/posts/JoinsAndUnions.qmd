This blog post is to help data analysts understand data combination methods. It covers keys, joins (inner, left, right, and full outer), and unions. 

## Prerequisites 

* General understanding of datasets. 
* Optional: Some background with joins. 

# Key Concepts

## Primary and Foreign Keys

Before joining data sets, it's important to understand how tables can be connected through keys. Every join uses a pai of keys: a primary key and a foreign key. 

* A **primary key** is a variable (or set of variables) that uniquely identifies each observation. In the example below the primary key in the upper set is _Customers_, and in the lower set the priamy key is _Order ID_.
