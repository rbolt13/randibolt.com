Usually around the holidays, but this year I was busy moving, navigating a new job, and taking care of our dying kitty cat. My sweet little buddy, who passed away in the middle of January. Iâ€™ve also been running a job recruitment. Thatâ€™s pretty wild. It felt like I spent years interviewing and now I am on the other side of the table. This is wild stuff kids."
