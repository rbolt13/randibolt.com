    "text": "ðŸ’š Where I Came From ~\nI have a BS in Mathematics from Portland State University, where I studied statistics and first learned R. Before working in government, I worked in fintech and digital advertising. Earlier in my career, I held a variety of rolesâ€”accounting at a sheet metal company, admin / safety monitoring for a roofing business, and even managing shifts at Baskin-Robbins and a dispensary.\nMy background isnâ€™t just in dataâ€”I was also a trained dancer, studying pre-professionally at the San Francisco Conservatory of Ballet. Some of my biggest role models were my dance teachers, who taught me the value of instinct, adaptability, and looking at movement (or data) from multiple perspectives.\nWhen I was 21, I was in a head-on collision with a drunk driver, led to multiple jaw surgeries and a long recovery. That experience shaped my views on workplace support and the necessity of programs like paid leave. No one should have to struggle through major life events without the ability to take time off."
