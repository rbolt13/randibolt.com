# ðŸ“Š [COvid-19 Dashboard](https://rbolt13.github.io/covid-dashboard/)

The Covid-19 Dashboard is an interactive tool analyzing cases and fatalities in both the United States and my home state of Oregon. Originally created as a class project at the start of the pandemic, it has gone through multiple iterations to become a fully functional and informative resource for exploring trends over time.
