    "text": "ðŸ“Š 2024 Oscar Prediction Challenge\nThis interactive Shiny app presents the results of a survey where participants predicted the winners of various Oscar categories. Built as part of my efforts to create and share data-driven projects, the dashboard lets users explore trends, accuracy, and insights from the challenge.\n\n\n\n\nðŸ“Š COvid-19 Dashboard\nThe Covid-19 Dashboard is an interactive tool analyzing cases and fatalities in both the United States and my home state of Oregon. Originally created as a class project at the start of the pandemic, it has gone through multiple iterations to become a fully functional and informative resource for exploring trends over time."

    "text": "I was born, raised, and currently reside in the City of Rosesâ€”Portland, Oregon. I have a passion for making data meaningful, accessible, and equitable. I believe in continuously improving how we work with dataâ€”whether thatâ€™s through better governance, building tools, or supporting making informed data driven decisions. My portfolio is a collection of data visuals, blogs, and dashboards mostly built in R.\nI currently work in state government, where I lead data efforts to improve reporting, governance, and innovation at Paid Leave Oregon. I also collaborate with data analysts and engineers across agencies to build better data systems and insights.\nThe best way to reach me professionally is through LinkedInâ€”just send me a message. Email also works, but since my inbox is over a decade old, messages sometimes get lost in the noise."

    "text": "ðŸ’š Where I Came From ~\nI have a BS in Mathematics from Portland State University, where I studied statistics and first learned R. Before working in government, I worked in fintech and digital advertising. Earlier in my career, I held a variety of rolesâ€”accounting at a sheet metal company, admin / safety monitoring for a roofing business, and even managing shifts at Baskin-Robbins and a dispensary.\nMy background isnâ€™t just in dataâ€”I was also a trained dancer, studying pre-professionally at the San Francisco Conservatory of Ballet. Some of my biggest role models were my dance teachers, who taught me the value of instinct, adaptability, and looking at movement (or data) from multiple perspectives.\nWhen I was 21, I was in a head-on collision with a drunk driver, led to multiple jaw surgeries and a long recovery. That experience shaped my views on workplace support and the necessity of programs like paid leave. No one should have to struggle through major life events without the ability to take time off."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I was born, raised, and currently reside in the City of Rosesâ€”Portland, Oregon. I have a passion for making data meaningful, accessible, and equitable. I believe in continuously improving how we work with dataâ€”whether thatâ€™s through better governance, building tools, or supporting making informed data driven decisions. My portfolio is a collection of data visuals, blogs, and dashboards mostly built in R.\nI currently work in state government, where I lead data efforts to improve reporting, governance, and innovation at Paid Leave Oregon. I also collaborate with data analysts and engineers across agencies to build better data systems and insights.\nThe best way to reach me professionally is through LinkedInâ€”just send me a message. Email also works, but since my inbox is over a decade old, messages sometimes get lost in the noise."
