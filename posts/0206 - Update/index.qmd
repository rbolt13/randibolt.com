I've updated my blog, and have some updates about life.

# Introduction

Every year I update my blog. Usually around the holidays, but this year I was busy moving, navigating a new job, and taking care of our dying kitty cat. My sweet little buddy, who passed away in the middle of January. I've also been running a job recruitment. That's pretty wild. It felt like I spent years interviewing and now I am on the other side of the table. This is wild stuff kids.
